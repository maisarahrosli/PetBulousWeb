                    <h2 id="preparation"> 1. Be an Example <br></h2>
                    <p class="par1">
                        Your pet is more likely to be calm if you are. If you are stressed out before the vaccination appointment,
                         your pet will feel your anxiety. High-pitched praise and rushed demeanor can quickly transfer stress to
                          your pet, so try to keep a soft, calm voice and give yourself plenty of time to get to the office.</p>
                    
                    <h2 id="preparation"> 2. Use Treat to Calm  <br></h2>
                    <p class="par1">
                        Depends on some vets , they not allowed the pet to eat heavy meal, then use treats to calm them down so that 
                        they did not feel nervous to get vaccination</p> 
                     
                    <h2 id="preparation"> 3. Transport with care  <br></h2>
                    <p class="par1">
                    Before going straight to the vets, make sure your furry friends are comfortable with the car trip. You can 
                    For example, drive them around the neighborhood . And when they are ready, make sure place the carrier on a flat 
                    surface and covered with towel or any items that your cats adore to help them sit comfortably.</p>
                    
                    <h2 id="preparation"> 4. Partner With Your Vetenarian<br></h2>
                    <p class="par1">
                    Lastly, if allowed, when your furry friend are getting vaccination, make sure you stayed 
                    <br>beside them as they did not familiar enough with vets and also do not forget to 
                    <br>communicating all questions and concerns to your veterinarian to make sure your pet 
                    <br>receive quality care.</p>
